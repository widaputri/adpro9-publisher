a. How much data your publisher program will send to the message broker in one run?
In one run, my publisher program sends 5 messages to the message broker, where each message contains a serialized UserCreatedEventMessage struct with a user_id (e.g., "1") and a user_name (e.g., "2306229840-Amir"), totaling approximately 100–125 bytes (assuming ~20–25 bytes per message, including Borsh serialization overhead). The exact size may vary slightly based on string lengths and serialization details, but the payload remains minimal since it only consists of small text data.

b. The url of: “amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672” is the same as in the subscriber program, what does it mean?
The identical AMQP URL (amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672) in both the publisher and subscriber programs means they are connecting to the same RabbitMQ broker instance on the local machine, using the default credentials and port, ensuring that messages published to the user_created queue by the publisher are delivered to the subscriber, enabling proper communication between the two components through the centralized message broker.
